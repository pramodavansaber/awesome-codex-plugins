## Plugin Development

### Getting Started

- [Official Docs: Agent Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) - The skill authoring format.
- [Official Docs: Build Plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build) - Author and package plugins.
- [Plugin Structure](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build#create-a-plugin-manually) - `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest format.

### Plugin Anatomy

```
my-plugin/
├── .codex-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: name, version, description, skills path
├── skills/
│   └── my-skill/
│       ├── SKILL.md          # Required: skill instructions + metadata
│       ├── scripts/          # Optional: executable scripts
│       └── references/       # Optional: docs and templates
├── apps/                     # Optional: app integrations
└── mcp.json                  # Optional: MCP server configuration
```

### Plugin Creator

Use the built-in skill to scaffold a new plugin:

```
$plugin-creator
```

### Publishing

Currently no self-serve marketplace submission. Plugins are distributed via local marketplaces (`~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), repo marketplaces (`$REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), or GitHub repos by pointing a marketplace source at a repo. OpenAI has stated third-party marketplace submissions are coming soon.

## Scan Your Plugin

Before submitting a plugin, run the [codex-plugin-scanner](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/codex-plugin-scanner) to check for security issues and best practices. It scores your plugin from 0-100 and generates actionable findings.

### Quick Check

```bash
pip install codex-plugin-scanner
codex-plugin-scanner ./my-plugin
```

### CI Integration

Add to your plugin's GitHub Actions as a PR gate:

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/codex-plugin-scanner/action@v1.1.0
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    min_score: 70
    fail_on_severity: high
```

### Pre-commit Hook

Catch issues before they reach CI:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/hashgraph-online/codex-plugin-scanner
    rev: v1.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: codex-plugin-scanner
```

### What It Checks

| Category | Max Points |
|----------|-----------|
| Manifest Validation | 25 |
| Security | 20 |
| Best Practices | 15 |
| Marketplace | 15 |
| Skill Security | 15 |
| Code Quality | 10 |

Plugins scoring **80+** get a "Verified by Scanner" badge in this list.

- [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins) - Browse plugins with scanner-backed security analysis and trust scores. Auto-ingests this list and augments each plugin with detailed trust breakdowns, security labels, embeddable badges, and install guidance.

## Plugin Trust Scores

Every plugin in this list is automatically ingested by the [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins), which runs each through the [codex-plugin-scanner](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/codex-plugin-scanner) to produce a trust score and security analysis.

Each plugin gets a detailed breakdown across six factors:

- **Installability** - Can the plugin be installed and run without errors?
- **Maintenance** - Is the repo actively maintained with clear documentation?
- **MCP Posture** - How securely are MCP servers configured?
- **Plugin Security** - Does the manifest follow security best practices?
- **Provenance** - Can the publisher's identity be verified?
- **Publisher Quality** - Does the publisher have a track record of quality releases?

You can embed a trust badge in your plugin's README:

```
[![Plugin Name on HOL Registry (Trust Score)](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhol.org%2Fapi%2Fregistry%2Fbadges%2Fplugin%3Fslug%3DOWNER%252FREPO%26metric%3Dtrust%26style%3Dfor-the-badge%26label%3DPlugin+Name)](https://hol.org/registry/plugins/OWNER%2FREPO)
```

Replace `OWNER%2FREPO` with your plugin's GitHub owner and repo name (URL-encoded slash). Metrics available: `trust`, `security`. Styles: `flat`, `flat-square`, `plastic`, `for-the-badge`, `social`.
