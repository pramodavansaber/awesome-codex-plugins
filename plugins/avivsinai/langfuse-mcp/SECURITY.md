1. **API Keys**: Keep your Langfuse API keys secure and do not expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
2. **Access Control**: The MCP server has access to your Langfuse data. Be mindful of who has access to the MCP server configuration.
3. **Data Sensitivity**: Consider what data is being stored in Langfuse and what information might be exposed through the MCP tools.
