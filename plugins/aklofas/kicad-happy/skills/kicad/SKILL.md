name: kicad
description: Analyze KiCad EDA projects and PDF schematics — schematics, PCB layouts, Gerbers, footprints, symbols, design rules, netlists. Review designs for bugs, suggest improvements, extract BOMs, trace nets, cross-reference schematic to PCB, verify DRC/ERC, check DFM, analyze power trees and regulator circuits. Also analyze PDF schematics from dev boards, reference designs, eval kits, and datasheets — extract subcircuits, component values, and connectivity for incorporation into KiCad projects. Supports KiCad 5–10. Use whenever the user mentions KiCad files (.kicad_sch, .kicad_pcb, .kicad_pro), PCB design review, schematic analysis, PDF schematics, reference designs, Gerber files, DRC/ERC, netlist issues, BOM extraction, signal tracing, power budget, design for manufacturing, or wants to understand, debug, compare, or review any hardware design. Also use when the user says things like "check my board", "review before fab", "what's wrong with my schematic", "is this design ready to order", "check my power supply", "verify this motor driver circuit", or asks about any electronics/PCB design topic.

Hand off to `emc` for EMC pre-compliance risk analysis — run automatically during design reviews when both schematic and PCB analysis are available.

## PDF Schematic Analysis

This skill also handles **PDF schematics** — reference designs, dev board schematics, eval board docs, application notes, and datasheet typical-application circuits. Common use cases:

- Analyze a manufacturer's reference design to understand the circuit
- Extract a subcircuit (power supply, USB interface, sensor front-end) to incorporate into your own KiCad design
- Compare a PDF reference design against your own schematic
- Extract a full BOM from a PDF schematic
- Validate component values in a PDF against current datasheets

**Workflow:** Read the PDF pages visually → identify components and connections → extract structured data → translate to KiCad symbols and nets → validate against datasheets.

For the full methodology — component extraction, notation conventions, net mapping, subcircuit extraction, KiCad translation, and validation — read `references/pdf-schematic-extraction.md`.

For deep validation of extracted circuits against datasheets (verifying values, checking patterns, detecting errors), use the methodology in `references/schematic-analysis.md`.

## Analysis Scripts

This skill includes Python scripts that extract comprehensive structured JSON from KiCad files in a single pass. Run these first, then reason about the output.

Read analyzer JSON output directly rather than writing ad-hoc extraction scripts. The JSON schema has specific field names (documented below and in `references/output-schema.md`) that are easy to get wrong in custom code. To extract a specific section: `python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('file.json')); print(json.dumps(d['key'], indent=2))"`.

**Before writing any ad-hoc Python to process analyzer output**, run `--schema` to see the exact field names and types:
```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_schematic.py --schema
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_pcb.py --schema
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_gerbers.py --schema
```
This prevents format-string bugs and wrong field names. Use f-strings or `json.dumps()` for output formatting — never `%s` with non-string types. See `references/output-schema.md` for the full schema with common extraction patterns.

In all commands below, `<skill-path>` refers to this skill's base directory (shown at the top of this file when loaded).

### Schematic Analyzer
```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_schematic.py <file.kicad_sch>
```
Outputs structured JSON (~60-220KB depending on board complexity) with:
- **Components & BOM**: inventory with reference, value, footprint, lib_id, type classification, MPN, datasheet; deduplicated BOM with quantities
- **Nets**: full connectivity map with pin-to-net mapping, wire counts, no-connects
- **Signal analysis** (automated subcircuit detection):
  - Power regulators — LDO/switching/inverting topology, Vout estimation via datasheet-verified Vref lookup (~60 families) with heuristic fallback and fixed-output suffix parsing, `vref_source` (`lookup`/`heuristic`/`fixed_suffix`) and `vout_net_mismatch` fields
  - Voltage dividers, RC/LC filters (cutoff frequency), feedback networks, crystal circuits (load cap analysis, IC pin-based detection)
  - Op-amp circuits (configuration, gain, integrator/compensator), transistor circuits (net-name-aware load classification: motor/heater/fan/solenoid/valve/pump/relay/speaker/buzzer/lamp; FET level shifter topology)
  - Bridge circuits (H-bridge, 3-phase, cross-sheet detection), protection devices (ESD/TVS), current sense, decoupling analysis
  - Domain-specific: RF chains, RF matching networks, BMS, Ethernet (BFS PHY-to-connector tracing), HDMI/DVI interfaces, memory interfaces, key matrices (net-name and topology-based), isolation barriers, addressable LED chains (WS2812/SK6812/APA102), battery chargers (TP4056/MCP73831/BQ2404x), motor drivers (A4988/TMC2209/DRV8301), ESD protection coverage audit, debug interfaces (SWD/JTAG with MCU tracing), power path (load switches/ideal diodes/USB PD controllers), ADC signal conditioning (external ADCs + voltage references with anti-aliasing cross-ref), reset/supervisor circuits (voltage supervisors/watchdogs/RC reset networks), clock distribution (clock generators/PLLs/oscillator output tracing), display/touch interfaces (SSD1306/ILI9341/ST7789/FT6236/GT911), sensor fusion (IMU/environmental/magnetometer with interrupt validation and bus clustering), level shifters (IC-based + discrete BSS138 with supply domain mapping), audio circuits (amplifiers/codecs with I2S/class-D detection), LED driver ICs (PWM/matrix/constant-current), RTC circuits (battery backup/crystal pairing), LED lighting audit (current limiting validation), thermocouple/RTD interfaces (MAX31855/MAX31865), power sequencing validation (power tree/enable chain/PG daisy chain analysis)
- **IC pinout analysis**: pin-level connectivity, IC function classification (3-tier: library prefix, part number keywords, description fallback)
- **Power analysis**: PDN impedance (1kHz–1GHz with MLCC parasitics), power budget, power sequencing (EN/PG chains), sleep current audit (resistive paths + regulator Iq with EN detection), voltage derating, inrush estimation
- **Design analysis**: ERC warnings, power domains, bus detection (I2C/SPI/UART/CAN/RS-485 with COPI/CIPO/SDI/SDO), differential pairs (suffix-pair matching for USB/LVDS/Ethernet/HDMI/MIPI/PCIe/SATA/CAN/RS-485), cross-domain signals (voltage equivalence), BOM optimization, test coverage, assembly complexity, USB compliance
- **Quality checks**: annotation completeness, label validation, PWR_FLAG audit, footprint filter validation, sourcing audit, property pattern audit, generic transistor symbol detection (flags Q_NPN_*/Q_PNP_*/Q_NMOS_*/Q_PMOS_* symbols with datasheet availability check)
- **Structural**: MCU alternate pin summary, ground domain classification, bus topology, wire geometry, spatial clustering, pin coverage, hierarchical label validation

Supports modern `.kicad_sch` (KiCad 6+) and legacy `.sch` (KiCad 4/5). Hierarchical designs parsed recursively.

**Legacy format:** For KiCad 5 legacy `.sch` files, the analyzer parses `.lib` files (cache libraries and project libs) to populate pin data. Pin-to-net mapping, signal analysis, and subcircuit detection all work when `.lib` files are available. Coverage is typically 92–100% — components whose `.lib` files are missing (standard KiCad system libs not in the repo) will lack pin data. Built-in fallbacks cover 40+ common symbols (R, C, L, D, LED, transistors, MOSFETs, crystals, switches, polarized caps, connectors up to 20-pin, resistor packs) with mil-based pin offsets and automatic wire-snap correction for version-mismatched pin positions.

### Supplementary Data for Legacy Designs

When `analyze_schematic.py` returns incomplete data (components with missing pins due to unavailable `.lib` files), use additional project files to recover full analysis capability. The most valuable source is the `.net` netlist file, which provides explicit pin-to-net mapping that closes any remaining gaps.

For detailed parsing instructions, data recovery workflows, and a priority matrix of supplementary sources (netlist, cache library, PCB cross-reference, PDF exports), read `references/supplementary-data-sources.md`.

**Verify analyzer output against reality.** The analyzer can silently produce plausible-looking but incorrect results — wrong voltage estimates, missing MPNs, wrong pin-to-net mappings. These don't cause script errors; they just produce bad data that flows into your report. In testing across multiple boards, every project had at least one misleading analyzer output. Cross-reference against the raw `.kicad_sch` file:

1. **Component count** — grep for `(symbol (lib_id` blocks, subtract power symbols. Must match analyzer count exactly.
2. **Pin-to-net mapping** — verify the analyzer's pin-to-net mapping against the raw schematic for each component. Read the symbol block, trace wires/labels to confirm connections. Cross-reference IC pin assignments against the manufacturer's datasheet pin table. This is the highest-value verification step — a wrong pin mapping produces a non-functional board and is invisible to DRC/ERC.
3. **Physical correctness (not just consistency)** — consistency checks (schematic=PCB=analyzer all agree) are necessary but not sufficient. They only confirm the design is internally coherent — not that it matches the real-world part. The most dangerous case: a transistor symbol encodes a pinout assumption (like `Q_NPN_BEC` = pin 1=B, 2=E, 3=C) that doesn't match the actual part. Everything passes consistency checks, but the board is wrong. To catch this:
   - For transistors (BJT/MOSFET) in SOT-23, SOT-223, TO-252 and similar packages, the KiCad `lib_id` suffix encodes a pin ordering assumption. SOT-23 BJTs exist in at least 6 pinout variants (BEC, BCE, EBC, ECB, CBE, CEB); SOT-23 MOSFETs in GDS, GSD, SGD, DSG. If no MPN is specified, there's no way to verify the assumption — flag this as a critical ambiguity.
   - When an MPN is specified, verify the symbol's pin-to-pad assignment against the datasheet's pinout diagram for that specific package.
   - This principle extends beyond transistors — any component where multiple pin orderings exist for the same package (voltage regulators with different pin assignments, connectors with vendor-specific pinouts) needs MPN-level verification.
   - **When verification isn't possible, assess plausibility.** Not all unverified choices carry equal risk. Some align with strong conventions (the most common SOT-23 NPN pinout is BCE; 2N2222 in SOT-23 is almost always BCE); others go against convention or are genuinely ambiguous (SOT-23 MOSFETs have no dominant standard). When an MPN is missing and you can't verify, use domain knowledge — typical pinouts for that device type and package, manufacturer conventions, what the majority of parts in that category do — to assess whether the assumed pinout is likely correct, unusual, or a coin flip. Report the confidence level: "matches the most common convention" is different from "could go either way." This same reasoning applies to passive values (is 4.7kΩ a typical pull-up value for this bus?), circuit topologies (is this a standard application circuit?), and component selection (is this part commonly used for this purpose?).
4. **Net trace** — trace power rails and critical signal nets end-to-end through wires/labels. Verify the analyzer's pin list is complete for each net.
5. **Regulator Vout** — check the `vref_source` field. `"lookup"` means datasheet-verified (~60 families); `"heuristic"` means it's a guess that needs manual verification. The `vout_net_mismatch` field flags estimated Vout differing >15% from the output rail name voltage.
6. **Hierarchical connectivity** — on multi-sheet designs, verify sub-sheet connections are reflected in the net data.

See `references/schematic-analysis.md` Step 2 for the full verification checklist. If the script fails or returns unexpected results, see `references/manual-schematic-parsing.md` for the complete fallback methodology.

### PCB Layout Analyzer
```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_pcb.py <file.kicad_pcb>
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_pcb.py <file.kicad_pcb> --proximity  # add crosstalk analysis
```
Outputs structured JSON (~50-300KB depending on board complexity) with:
- **Core**: footprint inventory (pads, courtyards, net assignments, extended attrs, schematic cross-reference), track/via statistics, zone summaries, board outline/dimensions, routing completeness
- **Zones & copper presence**: zone outline vs filled polygon bounding boxes, fill ratio, cross-layer copper presence at every pad (which components have zone copper on the opposite layer and which don't), same-layer foreign zone detection
- **Via analysis**: type breakdown (through/blind/micro), annular ring checks, via-in-pad detection, BGA/QFN fanout patterns, current capacity, stitching via identification, tenting
- **Signal integrity**: per-net trace length, layer transition tracking (ground return paths), trace proximity/crosstalk (with `--proximity`)
- **Power & thermal**: current capacity per net, power net routing summary, ground domain identification (AGND/DGND), zone stitching via density, thermal pad detection and via counting
- **Manufacturing**: placement analysis (courtyard overlaps, edge clearance), decoupling cap distances, DFM scoring (JLCPCB standard/advanced tier), tombstoning risk (0201/0402 thermal asymmetry), thermal pad via adequacy, silkscreen documentation audit

Add `--full` to include individual track/via coordinates, per-segment trace impedance (microstrip Z0 from stackup), pad-to-pad routed distances, return path continuity analysis, and via stub lengths. The `--full` output feeds the `spice` skill's parasitic extraction (`extract_parasitics.py`) for PCB-aware simulation. Supports KiCad 5 legacy format.

**Zone fills must be current.** The copper presence analysis uses KiCad's filled polygon data, which is computed when the user runs Edit → Fill All Zones (shortcut `B`) and stored in the `.kicad_pcb` file. If the board was modified after the last fill, the filled polygon data may be stale and the copper presence results will be inaccurate. When reviewing copper presence data, note whether the `fill_ratio` seems reasonable — a zone with 0 filled area or `is_filled: false` likely hasn't been filled.

**Zone outline ≠ actual copper.** The zone `outline_bbox` is the user-drawn boundary; `filled_bbox` is where copper actually exists after clearances, keepouts, and priority cuts. The `copper_presence` section shows which components have zone copper on the opposite layer — use this for capacitive touch pad isolation, antenna keep-out, and thermal analysis instead of inferring copper presence from zone outlines.

**Copper-sensitive components need deeper checks.** For capacitive touch pads and antennas, confirming "no opposite-layer copper" is necessary but not sufficient. The copper absence could be accidental — one zone refill after a routing change could add copper and kill touch sensitivity or detune the antenna. Check for explicit **keepout zones** (rule areas) that enforce the copper-free area as a DRC rule. Also measure same-layer GND clearance around touch pads and compare against the controller's app note minimum. For touch pads, compare trace lengths across all pads — significant asymmetry shifts baseline readings per channel. Report physical details (pad size, position, clearance, trace width/length) for all copper-sensitive components. See `references/pcb-layout-analysis.md` → Copper-Sensitive Components for the full checklist.

**Verify after every run:** Confirm footprint count and board outline dimensions against the raw `.kicad_pcb` file. Verify pad-to-net assignments for IC footprints against the schematic's pin-to-net mapping — this catches library footprint errors where pad numbering doesn't match the symbol pinout. If the script fails, see `references/manual-pcb-parsing.md` for the fallback methodology.

### Gerber & Drill Analyzer
```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_gerbers.py <gerber_directory/>
```
Outputs: layer identification (X2 attributes), component/net/pin mapping (KiCad 6+ TO attributes), aperture function classification, trace width distribution, board dimensions, drill classification (via/component/mounting), layer completeness, alignment verification, pad type summary (SMD/THT ratio). Add `--full` for complete pin-to-net connectivity dump. ~10KB JSON.

If the script fails or returns unexpected results, see `references/manual-gerber-parsing.md` for the complete fallback methodology for parsing raw Gerber/Excellon files directly.

All scripts output JSON to stdout by default. Use `--output file.json` to write to a file, `--compact` for single-line JSON.

**Analyzer JSON is worth keeping** — these are expensive to regenerate (large schematics take time). Use `--output` to save them for multi-pass analysis. They're not worth committing to git, but don't delete them between analysis steps.

### Generated Files

The analysis workflow creates files in the project tree. Analyzer JSON and design review reports use user-chosen filenames, so track what you create:

1. **Tell the user** what files were created and where
2. **Record them** in the project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` under a "Generated files" section (create one if needed) so future sessions can find or clean them up
3. **When the user asks to clean up**, remove generated reports and analyzer JSON. Check `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` for the file list — filenames vary per session.

| File Type | Example | Regenerable? | Commit to git? |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Analyzer JSON (`--output`) | `schematic_analysis.json` | Yes (expensive) | No |
| Design review report | `review.md`, `power_tree_review.md` | Yes | Optional — user may want to keep for reference |

**Workflow:** When analyzing a KiCad project, scan the project directory for all available file types and run every applicable analyzer — not just the one the user mentioned. A complete analysis uses all the data available:

1. **Scan the project directory** for `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb`, `.kicad_pro`, gerber directories, and `.net`/`.xml` netlist files
2. **Run all applicable scripts** — if the schematic exists, run `analyze_schematic.py`. If the PCB exists, run `analyze_pcb.py`. If gerbers exist, run `analyze_gerbers.py`. Run them in parallel when possible.
3. **Sync datasheets** (see Datasheet Acquisition below) — this step is a prerequisite for verification, not optional. Without datasheets, all subsequent verification is reduced to internal consistency checks — confirming the design agrees with itself, not that it's correct. Run the sync before reading any analyzer output. If sync fails or no API keys are available, use fallback methods (Datasheet property URLs, individual downloads via `digikey` skill, ask the user). If critical IC datasheets can't be obtained, note this prominently in the report as a verification gap.
4. **Read the `.kicad_pro`** project file directly (it's JSON) for design rules, net classes, and DRC/ERC settings
5. **Cross-reference outputs** between schematic and PCB (see section below) — this catches the most dangerous bugs (swapped pins, missing nets, footprint mismatches)
6. **Run SPICE simulation** (if a simulator is available) — hand off to the `spice` skill with the schematic analysis JSON. This validates filter frequencies, divider ratios, opamp gains, and more against actual simulation results. If both schematic and PCB analysis exist, use `--parasitics` for high-impedance circuits (>100K feedback dividers, LC filters, RF matching networks). Include results in the Simulation Verification section of the report.
7. **Verify each output** against the raw files and datasheets before using the data in your report
8. **Produce a unified report** covering schematic analysis, PCB layout analysis, simulation verification, and cross-reference findings. See `references/report-generation.md` for the report template.

The more data sources you combine, the more confident the analysis. A schematic-only review misses layout issues; a PCB-only review misses design intent. Always use everything available.

### Analysis Depth

Default to thorough analysis unless the user asks for a quick review. The reason: the bugs that kill boards are the ones that look correct at a glance. A spot-check might confirm 5 ICs are correct while the 6th has pins 3 and 4 swapped — and that's the one that kills the board. Thoroughness principles:

- **Verify all components, not a sample.** Pin-to-net errors on "simple" parts (reversed diode, wrong resistor in a divider, connector with wrong pin ordering) are just as fatal as swapped IC pins. Cover the full design.
- **Use datasheets as ground truth — not KiCad library symbols.** The analyzer, raw schematic, and KiCad library files all tell you what the design *says* — only the manufacturer's PDF datasheet tells you what it *should* say. A library symbol with a wrong pin mapping is the most dangerous class of bug precisely because everything is internally consistent: schematic, PCB, and analyzer all agree, but the board doesn't work. Verifying a pin assignment against the `.kicad_sym` file is circular — it's the source of the potential error. Download datasheets before starting verification (see "Datasheet Acquisition" below), open the actual PDF for each IC, extract the pin function table, and cite page/section numbers when reporting verification results.
- **Assess plausibility, not just verifiability.** When something can't be verified (missing MPN, missing datasheet), don't stop at "unverified." Use domain knowledge to assess whether the design choice aligns with common conventions or looks unusual. A 10kΩ I2C pull-up is unremarkable; a 100Ω I2C pull-up warrants a closer look even without a datasheet to check against. An SOT-23 NPN with BCE pinout matches the most common convention; one with CEB is unusual enough to flag. The goal is to distinguish "unverified but probably fine" from "unverified and suspicious." This applies to pinouts, passive values, circuit topologies, and component selection.
- **Think beyond what the analyzer detects.** The analyzer only finds patterns it's programmed for. When a section has no automated data, consider whether that's because the design doesn't need it (fine — say so briefly) or because the analyzer can't detect it (reason about it manually). Not every section needs a paragraph — "Not applicable: battery-powered, no mains input" is sufficient. But don't let empty data create blind spots in areas that matter for the specific design.

### Datasheet Acquisition

Datasheets are what separate a consistency check from a correctness check. Without them, you can confirm the design agrees with itself — but not that it matches the real-world parts. Obtain datasheets early in the workflow.

**Automated sync (preferred):** Run datasheet sync scripts early in the workflow. They download datasheets for all components with MPNs into a shared `datasheets/` directory with an `index.json` manifest. Run the preferred source first; if some parts fail, try others — they share the same directory and skip already-downloaded files.

```bash
python3 <digikey-skill-path>/scripts/sync_datasheets_digikey.py <file.kicad_sch>
python3 <lcsc-skill-path>/scripts/sync_datasheets_lcsc.py <file.kicad_sch>
python3 <element14-skill-path>/scripts/sync_datasheets_element14.py <file.kicad_sch>
python3 <mouser-skill-path>/scripts/sync_datasheets_mouser.py <file.kicad_sch>
```

DigiKey is best (direct PDF URLs). element14 is reliable (no bot protection). LCSC works for LCSC-only parts. Mouser is a last resort (often blocks downloads).

**Check for existing datasheets:** Before downloading, look for:
- `<project>/datasheets/` with `index.json` (from a previous sync)
- `<project>/docs/` or `<project>/documentation/`
- PDF files in the project directory whose names contain MPNs
- `Datasheet` property URLs embedded in the KiCad symbols

**Fallback methods when automated sync isn't available or misses parts:**
1. Use the `Datasheet` property URL from the schematic symbol — many KiCad libraries include direct PDF links
2. Use the `digikey` skill to search by MPN and download individual datasheets
3. Use WebSearch to find the manufacturer's datasheet page
4. **Ask the user** — if a critical component's datasheet can't be found automatically, tell the user which parts are missing and ask them to provide the datasheets. Don't silently skip verification because a datasheet wasn't available. Example: "I couldn't find datasheets for U3 (XYZ1234) and U7 (ABC5678). Can you provide them? I need them to verify the pinout and application circuit."

**Structured datasheet extraction (for large designs or repeated reviews):** Pre-extract datasheet specs into cached JSON for faster, more consistent pin verification. This is especially valuable for designs with 10+ ICs where re-reading PDFs from scratch each time is slow.

```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/datasheet_page_selector.py <pdf_path> --mpn <mpn> --category <category>
```

After Claude reads the selected pages and produces an extraction JSON, score and cache it using `datasheet_score` and `datasheet_extract_cache` modules. Extractions are stored in `datasheets/extracted/<MPN>.json` and reused across reviews. See `references/datasheet-extraction.md` for the full schema, extraction guidance, and scoring rubric.

**What to extract from each datasheet** (note page/section/figure/equation numbers for citations):
- Pin function table (pin number → name → function)
- Absolute maximum ratings (voltage, current, temperature — including max continuous current through VCC/GND pins, which constrains inrush)
- Recommended application circuit and required external components
- Required component values (and the equations that derive them)
- Thermal characteristics

**For passives:** While individual resistor/capacitor datasheets are rarely needed, verify the component values against the IC datasheets that specify them. The IC's datasheet says "use a 10µF input cap" — verify the schematic actually has 10µF there, not 1µF.

**Anti-pattern: verification without datasheets.** The most common failure mode in design review is verifying component connections against KiCad library symbols instead of manufacturer datasheets. This is circular — if the library symbol has a wrong pin mapping, the schematic, PCB, and analyzer output will all agree with each other (and with the wrong pinout). Only the datasheet reveals the error. This is especially dangerous for custom/community library symbols (e.g., `sacmap:TPS61023`) where there's no upstream KiCad library as a secondary check. If you find yourself verifying a pinout by reading the `.kicad_sym` file or the analyzer's pin data and confirming it matches the schematic — stop. That's a consistency check, not a correctness check. Open the actual PDF datasheet, find the pin function table, and verify against that. Cite the datasheet page/section/figure number in your report so the designer can confirm your work.

### Schematic + PCB Cross-Reference

When both files exist, cross-reference them. This catches the most expensive bugs — swapped pins, missing nets, and footprint mismatches pass DRC/ERC but produce non-functional boards.

1. **Component count**: Schematic count (excluding power symbols) vs PCB footprint count.
2. **Net consistency**: Verify schematic net names appear in PCB net declarations. Missing nets suggest incomplete routing or un-synced changes.
3. **Pin-net assignments**: Compare schematic pin-to-net mapping against PCB pad-to-net mapping. Mismatches reveal swapped pins or library errors. Higher-risk areas:
   - Custom/community library symbols (may not match datasheet pinout)
   - Multi-unit symbols (op-amps, gate arrays) — unit-to-pin assignment errors
   - QFN/BGA packages — pad numbering mistakes
   - Transistors without MPNs — pinout ambiguity (see verification step 3)
   - Polarized components — anode/cathode orientation
   - Connectors — pin 1 orientation
4. **Footprint match**: Schematic `Footprint` property vs actual PCB footprint (e.g., SOT-23 vs SOT-23-5).
5. **DNP consistency**: DNP components in schematic should not have routing on PCB.
6. **Value/MPN consistency**: Values and MPNs match between schematic and PCB properties.

The PCB analyzer's `sch_path`, `sch_sheetname`, and `sch_sheetfile` fields in each footprint enable automated cross-referencing.

### Diff-Aware Design Comparison

Compare two analysis JSON outputs to see what changed between design revisions (e.g., base branch vs PR, v1 vs v2). Use when the user says things like "compare designs", "what changed", "diff my schematic", "show changes from main", or "diff base vs head".

```bash
# Compare two schematic analysis outputs
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/diff_analysis.py base.json head.json

# Human-readable text output
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/diff_analysis.py base.json head.json --text

# Write to file, custom threshold (ignore <2% deltas)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/diff_analysis.py base.json head.json --output diff.json --threshold 2.0
```

Auto-detects analyzer type (schematic, PCB, EMC, SPICE). Reports:
- **Components**: new, removed, value/footprint/MPN changes
- **Signal analysis**: parameter shifts (divider ratio, filter cutoff, opamp gain, regulator Vout)
- **EMC findings**: new/resolved findings with severity, risk score delta
- **SPICE results**: status transitions (pass→fail regressions, fail→pass fixes)
- **Severity classification**: none, minor, major, breaking

The GitHub Action supports `diff-base: true` to automatically compare PR changes against the base branch.

### Thermal Hotspot Estimation

Estimates junction temperatures of power-dissipating components by combining schematic power data with PCB thermal infrastructure (copper pour, thermal vias, package type). Use when the user says "check thermals", "thermal analysis", "will this overheat", "junction temperature", "power dissipation", or "thermal design".

```bash
# Run thermal analysis (requires both schematic and PCB JSON)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_thermal.py -s analysis.json -p pcb.json

# Human-readable text report
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_thermal.py -s analysis.json -p pcb.json --text

# Custom ambient temperature (default: 25°C)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/analyze_thermal.py -s analysis.json -p pcb.json --ambient 40 -o thermal.json
```

Models each power component (LDO, switching regulator, shunt resistor) as a point heat source. Computes Tj = T_ambient + P_diss × Rθ_JA_effective, where Rθ_JA comes from a package lookup table (SOT-223: 60°C/W, QFN-5x5: 25°C/W, etc.) and is corrected for PCB thermal vias and copper pour. Rules:

| Rule | Condition | Severity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| TS-001 | Tj exceeds absolute maximum | CRITICAL |
| TS-002 | Tj within 15°C of absolute maximum | HIGH |
| TS-003 | Tj > 85°C (may affect nearby passives) | MEDIUM |
| TS-004 | P > 0.5W with no thermal vias | MEDIUM |
| TS-005 | Significant power, within safe limits | INFO |
| TP-001 | MLCC within 10mm of hot component | LOW |
| TP-002 | Electrolytic cap within 10mm of hot component | MEDIUM |

### Interactive "What-If" Parameter Sweep

Instantly see the impact of component value changes on circuit behavior without re-running the full analyzer. Use when the user says "what if I change", "what happens if", "try a different value", "swap R5 to 4.7k", "parameter sweep", or wants to explore design trade-offs.

```bash
# Change one component
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/what_if.py analysis.json R5=4.7k

# Change multiple components
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/what_if.py analysis.json R5=4.7k C3=22n

# Include SPICE re-simulation on affected subcircuits
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/what_if.py analysis.json R5=4.7k --spice

# Export patched JSON for further analysis (EMC, thermal, diff)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/what_if.py analysis.json R5=4.7k --output patched.json

# Human-readable output
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/what_if.py analysis.json R5=4.7k --text
```

Finds all subcircuit detections referencing the changed component(s), patches values, recalculates derived fields (filter cutoff, divider ratio, opamp gain, etc.), and shows before/after comparison with percentage deltas. The `--spice` flag runs SPICE simulations on both original and patched circuits for dynamic verification. The `--output` flag exports a patched analysis JSON that can be fed to EMC, thermal, or diff analysis.

### Component Lifecycle & Temperature Audit

Queries distributor APIs to check component lifecycle status (active, NRND, EOL, obsolete) and operating temperature range coverage. Use when the user says "check for obsolete parts", "lifecycle audit", "are any parts end of life", "temperature audit", "will this work at industrial temp range", or during production readiness reviews.

```bash
# Basic lifecycle check
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/lifecycle_audit.py analysis.json

# With temperature range validation (preset or custom)
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/lifecycle_audit.py analysis.json --temp-range industrial
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/lifecycle_audit.py analysis.json --temp-range "-40,105"

# Query specific distributors only
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/lifecycle_audit.py analysis.json --only digikey,lcsc

# Search for replacement parts when EOL/NRND found
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/lifecycle_audit.py analysis.json --suggest-alternatives

# Save results
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/lifecycle_audit.py analysis.json --output lifecycle.json
```

Reads the analyzer JSON BOM section, extracts unique MPNs, queries distributors (LCSC no-auth, DigiKey, element14, Mouser) for lifecycle status and operating temperature. Temperature presets: `commercial` (0/70°C), `industrial` (-40/85°C), `extended` (-40/105°C), `automotive` (-40/125°C), `military` (-55/125°C). Also checks datasheet extraction cache for temperature data before making API calls.

**Requires network access** — unlike the core analyzers, this script calls distributor APIs. Same environment variables as the distributor skills (DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, MOUSER_SEARCH_API_KEY, ELEMENT14_API_KEY). LCSC requires no credentials.

## Analysis Strategies

### Deep Schematic Analysis

For a thorough datasheet-driven schematic review — identifying subcircuits, fetching datasheets, validating component values against manufacturer recommendations, comparing against common design patterns, detecting errors, and suggesting improvements — read `references/schematic-analysis.md`. Use this reference whenever the user asks to review, validate, or analyze a schematic in depth.

**Fetching datasheets**: When the analysis requires datasheet data, use the DigiKey API as the preferred source (see the `digikey` skill) — it returns direct PDF URLs via the `DatasheetUrl` field without web scraping. Search by MPN from the schematic's component properties. Fall back to WebSearch only for parts not on DigiKey.

### Deep PCB Analysis

For advanced layout analysis beyond what the PCB analyzer script provides — impedance calculations from stackup parameters, DRC rule authoring, power electronics design review techniques, differential pair validation, return path analysis, copper balance assessment, board edge clearance rules, and manual script-writing patterns — read `references/pcb-layout-analysis.md`.

Most routine PCB analysis (via types, annular ring, placement, connectivity, thermal vias, current capacity, signal integrity, DFM scoring, tombstoning risk, thermal pad vias) is handled automatically by `analyze_pcb.py`. Use the reference for deeper manual investigation.

### Quick Review Checklists

**Schematic** — verify: decoupling caps on every IC VCC/GND pair, I2C pull-ups, reset pin circuits, unconnected pins have no-connect markers, consistent net naming across sheets, ESD protection on external connectors, power sequencing (EN/PG), adequate bulk capacitance.

**PCB** — verify: power trace widths for current (IPC-2221), via current capacity, creepage/clearance for high voltage, decoupling cap proximity to IC power pins, continuous ground plane (no splits under signals), controlled impedance traces (USB/DDR), board outline closed polygon, silkscreen readability, thermal via count for every exposed-pad IC (report the count and compare against the datasheet's recommended range — this is one of the most common QFN/DFN layout errors), keepout zone enforcement for copper-sensitive components (touch pads and antennas — confirming copper absence isn't enough because it could be accidental; check that keepout zones exist as DRC rules), differential pair length deltas with protocol-specific tolerance (compute the delta and cite the spec — raw lengths alone don't tell the designer if there's a problem), pad-to-net cross-reference at PCB level for all ICs/transistors/connectors (catches library footprint pin numbering errors that are invisible to DRC/ERC — the most dangerous class of PCB bug). Consider `references/standards-compliance.md` for IPC/IEC standard values — conductor spacing and current capacity are relevant for most boards; creepage/clearance and via protection apply to mains-connected or safety-isolated designs.

**Common bugs (ranked by board-killing potential)**: swapped IC pins (library symbol vs datasheet pinout — invisible to DRC/ERC), transistor pinout ambiguity (SOT-23 without MPN — symbol assumes a pin ordering that may not match the real part; assess plausibility against common conventions when verification isn't possible), wrong footprint pad numbering, missing nets from un-synced schematic→PCB, wrong package variant (SOT-23 vs SOT-23-5), floating digital inputs, missing bulk caps, reversed polarity, incorrect feedback divider values, wrong crystal load caps, USB impedance mismatch, QFN thermal pad missing vias, connector pinout errors, unusual passive values (a value that's technically valid but uncommon for the application — e.g., a non-standard pull-up resistance, an unusual decoupling capacitor value).

### Report Generation

When producing a design review report, read `references/report-generation.md` for the standard report template, severity definitions, writing principles, and domain-specific focus areas. The report format covers: overview, component summary, power tree, analyzer verification (spot-checks), signal/power/design analysis review, quality & manufacturing, prioritized issues table, positive findings, and known analyzer gaps. Always cross-reference analyzer output against the raw schematic before reporting findings.

### Design Comparison
When comparing two designs, diff: component counts/types, net classes/design rules, track widths/via sizes, board dimensions/layer count, power supply topology, KiCad version differences.
