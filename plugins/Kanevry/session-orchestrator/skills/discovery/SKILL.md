# Discovery Skill

## Invocation Modes

Two modes of operation:

- **Standalone** (`/discovery [scope]`): Full 6-phase flow with interactive triage (Phases 0-6)
- **Embedded** (from session-end when `discovery-on-close: true`): Phases 0-4 only, returns structured findings to session-end

The `scope` argument accepts: `all` (default), `code`, `infra`, `ui`, `arch`, `session`, or comma-separated like `code,session`.

## Phase 0: Bootstrap Gate

Read `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` and execute the gate check. If the gate is CLOSED, invoke `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` and wait for completion before proceeding. If the gate is OPEN, continue to Phase 1.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT proceed past Phase 0 if GATE_CLOSED. There is no bypass. Refer to `skills/_shared/bootstrap-gate.md` for the full HARD-GATE constraints.
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase 1: Read Session Config

Read and parse Session Config per `skills/_shared/config-reading.md`. Store result as `$CONFIG`.

Discovery-relevant fields (parse these specifically):
- `discovery-on-close`, `discovery-probes`, `discovery-exclude-paths`, `discovery-severity-threshold`, `discovery-confidence-threshold`
- `test-command`, `typecheck-command`, `lint-command`
- `pencil`, `vcs`, `cross-repos`, `stale-issue-days`

## Phase 2: Stack Detection & Probe Activation

Detect the project's tech stack via marker file checks. Use Glob and run checks in parallel:

| Marker File(s)                        | Activates               |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `package.json`                        | JS/TS probes            |
| `tsconfig.json`                       | TypeScript probes       |
| `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` | Python probes           |
| `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml`   | Container probes        |
| `vercel.json` / `.vercel/`            | Vercel probes           |
| `.github/workflows/`                  | GitHub CI probes        |
| `.gitlab-ci.yml`                      | GitLab CI probes        |
| `supabase/`                           | Supabase probes         |
| `next.config.*` / `nuxt.config.*`     | SSR probes              |
| `tailwind.config.*`                   | Tailwind probes         |
| Pencil in Session Config              | design-drift probe      |

### Build Activation Set

1. Start with all probes whose marker files are present
2. If `discovery-probes` is set in config, intersect with that list
3. If a `scope` argument was passed, restrict to that category
4. Remove probes whose activation conditions are not met

### Exclude Paths

Default exclude paths (always apply):
- `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `coverage/`

Add any paths from `discovery-exclude-paths` in Session Config.

### VCS Detection

> **VCS Reference:** Detect the VCS platform per the "VCS Auto-Detection" section of the gitlab-ops skill.

### Status Report

Report: "Discovery: [N] probes active across [categories]. Stack: [detected]. Threshold: [severity]."

## Phase 3: Probe Execution

Dispatch probe agents IN PARALLEL using the Agent tool. Group by category (max 5 agents):

> **Cursor IDE:** No Agent() tool available. Run probes sequentially within the current session — one category at a time. Complete each category's analysis before moving to the next.

- **Code probes agent**: Runs all activated code probes (hardcoded-values, orphaned-annotations, dead-code, ai-slop, type-safety-gaps, test-coverage-gaps, test-anti-patterns, security-basics)
- **Infra probes agent**: Runs all activated infra probes
- **UI probes agent**: Runs all activated UI probes
- **Arch probes agent**: Runs all activated arch probes
- **Session probes agent**: Runs all activated session probes

Each agent receives:
- The probe definitions from `probes-intro.md` (confidence scoring reference) AND the category-specific `probes-<category>.md` file for this agent's category (include the actual grep commands/patterns in the prompt)
- The exclude paths list
- The project root path
- Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (read-only -- no Edit/Write)
- Instruction: "Run each probe. For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:"

```
FINDING:
  probe: <probe_name>
  category: <category>
  severity: <critical|high|medium|low>
  file_path: <absolute path>
  line_number: <number>
  matched_text: <exact text from tool output>
  title: <short title for the finding>
  description: <1-2 sentence description>
  recommended_fix: <concrete fix suggestion>
```

"If a probe's activation condition is not met, skip it with: SKIPPED: <probe_name> -- <reason>"
"If a probe command fails, skip it with: FAILED: <probe_name> -- <error>"
"Do NOT fabricate findings. Only report what tool output confirms."

CRITICAL: `run_in_background: false` for all agents.

Skip categories with no activated probes (don't dispatch empty agents).

## Phase 4: Verification & Scoring

After all probe agents complete:

### 4.1 Parse Findings

Collect all `FINDING:` blocks from agent outputs into a unified findings list.

### 4.2 Verification Pass

For EACH finding:
1. Read the file at `file_path:line_number` using the Read tool
2. Confirm `matched_text` appears at or near that line (+/-3 lines tolerance)
3. If NOT confirmed, discard with note "false positive -- text not found at reported location"
4. Report: "Verification: N confirmed, M discarded as false positives"

### 4.2a Confidence Scoring

For each verified finding, assign a confidence score (0-100) based on three factors:

| Factor | Low (+0) | Medium (+10) | High (+20) |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Pattern specificity | Generic match (URL, TODO) | Moderate (orphaned annotation, magic number) | Specific (API key regex, eval(), SQL injection) |
| File context | Test fixture, example, seed data, docs | Utility, config, scripts | Production source, API handler, middleware |
| Historical signal | Previously dismissed as false positive | No prior data (first occurrence) | Recurring issue (confirmed in learnings.jsonl) |

**Scoring rules:**
1. Start at 40 (baseline)
2. Add each factor's score (+0/+10/+20)
3. Clamp to 0-100 range
4. **Critical severity override:** findings with severity `critical` get a minimum confidence of 70 — they are NEVER auto-deferred

**Threshold:** Read `discovery-confidence-threshold` from Session Config (default: 60). If not configured, use 60.

Annotate each finding with its confidence score for Phase 5 presentation.

### 4.3 Deduplication

Two findings are duplicates if:
- Same `file_path` AND
- Overlapping line range (+/-5 lines) AND
- Different probes

Keep the higher severity finding. Merge descriptions.

### 4.4 Apply Thresholds

1. **Severity filter:** Remove findings below `discovery-severity-threshold` from Session Config.
2. **Confidence filter:** Remove findings with confidence score below `discovery-confidence-threshold` (default: 60). Log filtered-out findings: "Auto-dismissed N low-confidence findings (below threshold [T]). Use `discovery-confidence-threshold: 0` to see all."

### 4.5 Group by Category

Group remaining findings by category for Phase 5 presentation.

### 4.6 Embedded Mode Exit

If in embedded mode (called from session-end): STOP HERE. Return structured findings to the caller using this schema:

**Embedded mode return schema:**
```json
{
  "findings": [
    {"probe": "string", "category": "string", "severity": "critical|high|medium|low", "confidence": 0-100, "file": "string", "line": number, "description": "string", "recommendation": "string"}
  ],
  "stats": {
    "probes_run": number,
    "findings_raw": number,
    "findings_verified": number,
    "false_positives": number,
    "user_dismissed": 0,
    "issues_created": 0,
    "by_category": {"<category>": {"findings": number, "actioned": 0}}
  }
}
```

Present both as structured data in your final output. Do not proceed to Phase 5.

## Phase 5: Interactive Triage (Standalone Mode Only)

### 5.0 Auto-Defer Low-Confidence Findings

Before presenting findings for triage, separate by confidence threshold:

1. Findings with confidence >= threshold → present for interactive triage (below)
2. Findings with confidence < threshold → auto-defer with summary:
   "Auto-deferred [N] low-confidence findings (score < [threshold]). Review with `/discovery --include-deferred`."
3. List auto-deferred findings in a collapsed section (not interactive — informational only)

### 5.1 Present High-Confidence Findings

Present findings using AskUserQuestion -- NEVER plain text options. On Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists.

Include confidence scores in the presentation:
```
[CRITICAL] (confidence: 85) hardcoded-values: API key found in src/config.ts:42
[HIGH] (confidence: 72) security-basics: eval() usage in src/utils/parser.ts:18
[MEDIUM] (confidence: 61) orphaned-annotations: TODO without issue in src/lib/auth.ts:55
```

### Step 1: Summary

Present a findings overview table:

```
## Discovery Results

Probes run: [N] | Findings verified: [N] | False positives discarded: [N]

| Category | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Total |
|----------|----------|------|--------|-----|-------|
| Code     | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Infra    | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| UI       | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Arch     | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
| Session  | ...      | ...  | ...    | ... | ...   |
```

### Step 2: Critical + High Findings -- Review Individually

For each Critical or High finding, use AskUserQuestion (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "<finding title>\n\n<file_path>:<line_number>\n```\n<matched_text with +/-3 lines context>\n```\n\n<description>\n\nRecommended fix: <recommended_fix>",
    header: "<severity>",
    options: [
      { label: "Create issue (<severity>)", description: "Create a priority:<severity> issue for this finding" },
      { label: "Adjust priority", description: "Create issue with different priority" },
      { label: "Dismiss -- intentional", description: "This is by design, skip" },
      { label: "Dismiss -- false positive", description: "Detection was wrong, skip" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

If user selects "Adjust priority", ask which priority with another AskUserQuestion. On Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists.

### Step 3: Medium + Low Findings -- Review Batched

Group remaining findings by category. For each category with medium/low findings (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "[N] medium/low findings in [category]:\n\n1. [title] -- [file_path]:[line] ([severity])\n2. [title] -- [file_path]:[line] ([severity])\n...",
    header: "[Category]",
    options: [
      { label: "Accept all (Recommended)", description: "Create issues for all [N] findings" },
      { label: "Review individually", description: "Walk through each finding one by one" },
      { label: "Dismiss all", description: "Skip all medium/low findings in this category" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

If "Review individually" selected, walk through each like Step 2.

### Step 4: Batch Confirmation

Before creating any issues (on Codex CLI where AskUserQuestion is unavailable, present as numbered Markdown lists):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Ready to create [N] issues?\n\n- [X] critical\n- [Y] high\n- [Z] medium\n- [W] low",
    header: "Confirm",
    options: [
      { label: "Create all [N] issues", description: "Proceed with issue creation" },
      { label: "Review list first", description: "Show full list before creating" },
      { label: "Cancel", description: "Do not create any issues" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

## Phase 6: Issue Creation & Report

### 6.1 Issue Creation

> **VCS Reference:** Detect the VCS platform per the "VCS Auto-Detection" section of the gitlab-ops skill.
> Use CLI commands per the "Common CLI Commands" section.

For each approved finding:

1. Format using the Discovery Finding Issue Template from `issue-templates.md`
2. Determine labels: `type:discovery` + `priority:<level>` + `area:<inferred from category/filepath>` + `status:ready`
3. Create issue via VCS CLI:
   - **GitLab**: `glab issue create --title "[Discovery] <title>" --label "type:discovery,priority:<level>,area:<area>,status:ready" --description "<body>"`
   - **GitHub**: `gh issue create --title "[Discovery] <title>" --label "type:discovery,priority:<level>,area:<area>,status:ready" --body "<body>"`
4. Brief pause (1s) between creations for rate limiting

### 6.2 Final Report

```
## Discovery Report

### Summary
- Probes run: [N] across [categories]
- Raw findings: [N]
- Verified: [N] (false positives discarded: [M])
- User approved: [N]
- Issues created: [N]

### Created Issues
| # | Title | Priority | Area | Probe |
|---|-------|----------|------|-------|
| <IID> | <title> | <priority> | <area> | <probe> |

### Dismissed Findings
- [N] dismissed as intentional
- [M] dismissed as false positive

### Recommendations
- [suggestions based on finding patterns]
```

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER** fabricate findings -- every finding must come from tool output with verifiable evidence
- **NEVER** create issues without user approval (standalone mode)
- **ALWAYS** verify findings by re-reading the file at the reported line (Phase 4)
- **ALWAYS** use AskUserQuestion for triage decisions -- never plain text options (On Codex CLI, use numbered lists as AskUserQuestion is not available)
- **ALWAYS** reference gitlab-ops for VCS operations -- never duplicate CLI logic inline
- If a probe command fails or tool is unavailable, skip gracefully, continue with others
- If in embedded mode, stop after Phase 4, return findings as structured data
- Respect `discovery-severity-threshold` -- filter before presenting to user
- Default exclude paths always apply: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `coverage/`

## Phase 7: Capture Discovery Stats (Standalone Mode Only)

> This phase runs only in standalone mode. Embedded mode returns findings to the caller.

After Phase 6 (Issue Creation) completes, prepare discovery statistics for session metrics:

1. Count totals from the triage results:
   - `probes_run`: number of probes that were activated and executed
   - `findings_raw`: total findings before verification
   - `findings_verified`: findings that passed Phase 4.2 verification
   - `false_positives`: findings discarded during verification
   - `user_dismissed`: findings the user declined during Phase 5 triage
   - `issues_created`: issues created in Phase 6
   - `by_category`: per-category breakdown of findings and actioned items

2. Report stats summary:
   ```
   Discovery stats: [probes_run] probes, [findings_raw] raw → [findings_verified] verified ([false_positives] false positives). User dismissed [user_dismissed]. Created [issues_created] issues.
   ```

3. These stats are available for session-end to include in `sessions.jsonl` under the `discovery_stats` field. The discovery skill does NOT write to `sessions.jsonl` directly — session-end handles that.

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** report findings without verifying them first — false positives erode user trust faster than missed issues
- **DO NOT** skip the interactive triage phase — auto-creating issues for unconfirmed findings creates noise
- **DO NOT** run probes outside the configured scope — if the user asked for `code` scope, don't scan infrastructure
- **DO NOT** present findings without evidence (file path, line number, actual content) — assertions without proof are useless
- **DO NOT** write to `sessions.jsonl` directly — session-end handles metrics persistence
