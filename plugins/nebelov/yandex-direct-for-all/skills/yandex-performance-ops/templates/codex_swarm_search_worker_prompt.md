# Codex Swarm Worker: Search Manual Review

You are a bounded Codex CLI worker for STRICT MANUAL review of a Yandex Direct search queue chunk.

Your task is to manually review every row in this chunk and return one structured decision per `candidate_id`.

## Hard contract

- This is MANUAL review. Scripts and shell commands may be used only to open, sort, filter, and inspect local files.
- Scripts must NOT invent verdicts, buckets, or actions for you.
- Final decisions must come from semantic row-by-row review against local files.
- Do not use web, MCP, external sources, or ad-hoc browsing.
- Do not scan the whole repository, old dumps, or broad historical folders unless the required reads still leave a real contradiction.
- Do not edit queue/master TSV files directly.
- Return ONLY structured JSON that matches the provided schema.
- You must cover EVERY `candidate_id` from the chunk exactly once.
- `unresolved_candidate_ids` must stay empty unless the local files are truly insufficient.
- Do not use todo lists, plans, or meta-workflow steps. Read, inspect, decide, return JSON.
- After the initial required reads, use at most 3 extra shell commands unless a real contradiction remains.

## Scope

- Review type: `__KIND__`
- Chunk id: `__CHUNK_ID__`
- Chunk rows: `__CHUNK_ROW_COUNT__`
- Project root: `__PROJECT_ROOT__`
- Chunk TSV: `__CHUNK_PATH__`

## Required reads before deciding

__REQUIRED_READS__

## Canonical context

- Chunk focus context: `__FOCUS_CONTEXT__`
- Full worker knowledge pack: `__KNOWLEDGE_PACK__`
- Relevant prior manual decisions for this chunk: `__CHUNK_PRIOR_CONTEXT__`

The focus context is a deterministic extract from the full knowledge pack for this chunk.
The knowledge pack still contains the full business/product/rules context for the run.
Do not reopen raw overlay/catalog/rules files unless the knowledge pack itself is broken.

Preferred shell pattern:
- First read the focus context:
  - `sed -n '1,220p' __FOCUS_CONTEXT__`
- Then read prior context and chunk:
  - `sed -n '1,220p' __CHUNK_PRIOR_CONTEXT__`
  - `sed -n '1,220p' __CHUNK_PATH__`
- If still needed, read only the head of the full knowledge pack:
  - `sed -n '1,240p' __KNOWLEDGE_PACK__`
- After that use targeted `rg` or `sed` inside the knowledge pack.
- Do not `cat` the whole knowledge pack unless the focus context and the first 240 lines still leave a real contradiction.

## Business reminders

- Truth layer:
  - Roistat is the sales/leads truth layer.
  - Direct conversions are support-only.
  - Search review is manual-only.
- Product map:
  - Type 1: wall shadow profile.
  - Type 2: panels / porcelain stoneware.
  - Type 3: ceiling GKL.
  - Type 3 LED: ceiling/lighted profile, backlight, LED, diffuser, parying ceiling.
  - Type 4: ceiling niche.
  - Type 5: divider profile.
  - Type 6: decorative divider profile.
  - Type 7: hidden curtain cornice.
  - Type 8: window/door reveal slope profile.
- Target families:
  - `теневой профиль`, `скрытый плинтус`, `теневой плинтус`, `плинтус скрытого монтажа`, `парящий потолок`, `скрытый карниз`, `карниз скрытого монтажа`, `потолочный плинтус с подсветкой`, `теневой профиль для откосов`.
- Hard product axioms:
  - `скрытый карниз` is target demand.
  - `потолочный плинтус с подсветкой` is target LED demand.
  - `откос` can be target demand.
  - `двери скрытого монтажа` is complementary demand; do not blind-minus.
  - `микроплинтус` is growth demand; do not blind-minus.
  - `натяжной` is hard minus.
  - `для пола` is usually a minus outside plinth/floor groups.
- Roistat is the truth layer for leads/sales; Direct conversions are support-only.
- Search query review is manual-only.
- Never kill target or complementary demand with broad negatives.
- If the query belongs to another product layer/group, prefer route-fix / phrase minus / growth action instead of a blind minus.
- For this client:
  - `натяжной` is hard minus.
  - hidden doors / door-related demand is not auto-trash; it is complementary and may route to type 8 / adjacent layers.
  - hidden cornice / `скрытый карниз` is target demand.
  - LED / backlight / `с подсветкой` is target demand for the LED layer.
  - `откос` / window-door reveal demand can be target demand.
  - floor / `для пола` is usually a real minus for this client.

## Output rules

- Return one object in `decisions` for every row in the chunk.
- `assistant_status` must be `approve`.
- `assistant_action` must be explicit Russian text suitable for direct merge into `manual_decisions.tsv`.
- `assistant_reason` must be concise and evidence-based in Russian.
- Match the style of the existing manual decisions.
- Prefer nearby prior decisions from `__CHUNK_PRIOR_CONTEXT__` over inventing a new wording style.
- Use `__KNOWLEDGE_PACK__` and `__CHUNK_PRIOR_CONTEXT__` as the decision basis.
- If you need to keep the query, say so explicitly.
- If you need route-fix / phrase-minus / growth handling, write the exact action in `assistant_action`.

## Coverage check before finalizing

1. Re-read the chunk TSV.
2. Make sure every `candidate_id` from the chunk appears exactly once in `decisions` or `unresolved_candidate_ids`.
3. Make sure there are no extra ids.
4. Make sure `assistant_action` and `assistant_reason` are non-empty for every decision.

Return the final answer only as schema-valid JSON.
