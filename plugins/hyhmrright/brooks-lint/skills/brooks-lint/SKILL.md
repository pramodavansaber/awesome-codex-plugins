# Brooks-Lint

Code quality diagnosis using principles from ten classic software engineering books.

## The Iron Law

```
NEVER suggest fixes before completing risk diagnosis.
EVERY finding must follow: Symptom → Source → Consequence → Remedy.
```

Violating this law produces reviews that list rule violations without explaining why they
matter. A finding without a consequence and a remedy is not a finding — it is noise.

## When to Use

**Auto-triggers:**
- User asks to review code, check a PR, or assess code quality
- User shares code and asks "what do you think?" or "is this good?"
- User discusses architecture, module structure, or system design
- User asks why the codebase is hard to maintain, why velocity is declining
- User mentions: code smells, refactoring, clean architecture, DDD, SOLID, Brooks,
  conceptual integrity, second system effect, tech debt, ubiquitous language,
  test smells, test debt, unit testing quality, flaky tests, mock abuse,
  legacy code testability, characterization tests

**Slash command triggers (forced mode — skip mode detection):**
- `/brooks-lint:brooks-review` → Mode 1: PR Review
- `/brooks-lint:brooks-audit` → Mode 2: Architecture Audit
- `/brooks-lint:brooks-debt` → Mode 3: Tech Debt Assessment
- `/brooks-lint:brooks-test` → Mode 4: Test Quality Review

## Mode Detection

Read the context and pick ONE mode before doing anything else.

| Context | Mode |
|---------|------|
| Code diff, specific files/functions, PR description, "review this" | **Mode 1: PR Review** |
| Project directory structure, module questions, "audit the architecture" | **Mode 2: Architecture Audit** |
| "tech debt", "where to refactor", health check, systemic maintainability questions | **Mode 3: Tech Debt Assessment** |
| Test files shared, "are our tests good?", test debt, flaky tests, mock abuse, legacy code testability | **Mode 4: Test Quality Review** |
| User used a slash command | **Forced to that command's mode** |

**If context is genuinely ambiguous after reading:** ask once — "Should I do a PR-level code
review, a broader architecture audit, or a tech debt assessment?" — then proceed without
further clarification questions.

## Project Config

Before executing any mode, attempt to read `.brooks-lint.yaml` from the project root.
If the file exists, parse and apply its settings before proceeding.
If the file does not exist, continue with defaults (all risks enabled, no ignores).

In a multi-mode session, re-read only if the user says the config has changed.

### Supported settings

**`disable`** — list of risk codes to skip entirely. Findings for disabled risks are
silently omitted from the report and do not affect the Health Score.
Valid codes: `R1` `R2` `R3` `R4` `R5` `R6` `T1` `T2` `T3` `T4` `T5` `T6`

**`severity`** — override the severity of a specific risk for this project.
Valid values: `critical` `warning` `suggestion`
Example: `R1: suggestion` means every R1 finding is downgraded to Suggestion regardless
of what the guide says.

**`ignore`** — list of glob patterns. Files matching any pattern are excluded from
analysis. Findings that arise solely from ignored files are omitted.
Common entries: `**/*.generated.*`, `**/vendor/**`, `**/migrations/**`

**`focus`** — non-empty list of risk codes to evaluate; all others are skipped.
Omit this key (or leave it empty) to evaluate all non-disabled risks.
Cannot be combined with a non-empty `disable` list.

### Example `.brooks-lint.yaml`

```yaml
version: 1

disable:
  - T3   # no coverage metrics enforced on this project

severity:
  R1: suggestion   # high cognitive load is accepted in this domain

ignore:
  - "**/*.generated.*"
  - "**/vendor/**"
```

### Config Validation

Before applying, check for errors and mention each in the report:
- Invalid risk code (not R1–R6 or T1–T6): skip it, note `"Config warning: X is not a valid risk code"`
- Invalid severity value (not `critical`/`warning`/`suggestion`): skip it, note the error
- Both `disable` and `focus` are non-empty: treat as a config error, ignore both, note it

If the YAML fails to parse entirely, skip config loading and proceed with defaults.

### Reporting

If a config file was found and applied, add this line immediately after the **Scope** line
in the report:
`Config: .brooks-lint.yaml applied (N risks disabled, M paths ignored)`

Include N and M even if zero. Omit this line if no config file was found.

## The Six Decay Risks

(Full definitions, symptoms, sources, and severity guides are in `decay-risks.md` — read it
after selecting a mode.)

| Risk | Diagnostic Question |
|------|---------------------|
| Cognitive Overload | How much mental effort to understand this? |
| Change Propagation | How many unrelated things break on one change? |
| Knowledge Duplication | Is the same decision expressed in multiple places? |
| Accidental Complexity | Is the code more complex than the problem? |
| Dependency Disorder | Do dependencies flow in a consistent direction? |
| Domain Model Distortion | Does the code faithfully represent the domain? |

## Modes

### Mode 1: PR Review

1. Read `pr-review-guide.md` in this directory for the analysis process
2. Read `decay-risks.md` in this directory for symptom definitions and source attributions
3. Scan the diff or code for each decay risk in the order specified in the guide
4. Apply the Iron Law to every finding
5. Output using the Report Template below

### Mode 2: Architecture Audit

1. Read `architecture-guide.md` in this directory for the analysis process
2. Read `decay-risks.md` in this directory for symptom definitions and source attributions
3. Draw the module dependency graph as a Mermaid diagram (Step 1 of the guide)
4. Scan for each decay risk in the order specified in the guide
5. Assign node colors in the Mermaid diagram based on findings (red/yellow/green)
6. Run the Conway's Law check
7. Output using the Report Template below — Mermaid graph FIRST, then Findings

### Mode 3: Tech Debt Assessment

1. Read `debt-guide.md` in this directory for the analysis process
2. Read `decay-risks.md` in this directory for symptom definitions and source attributions
3. Scan for all six decay risks; list every finding before scoring any of them
4. Apply the Pain × Spread priority formula
5. Output using the Report Template below, plus the Debt Summary Table

### Mode 4: Test Quality Review

1. Read `test-guide.md` in this directory for the analysis process
2. Read `test-decay-risks.md` in this directory for symptom definitions and source attributions
3. Build the test suite map (unit/integration/E2E counts and ratio)
4. Scan for each test decay risk in the order specified in the guide
5. Output using the Report Template below

## Report Template

**Language rule:** Output the report in the same language the user is using. Translate the
per-finding content and the one-sentence verdict to match the user's language. Keep the
following in English: Iron Law field labels (Symptom / Source / Consequence / Remedy),
book titles, principle and smell names (e.g. "Shotgun Surgery", "Divergent Change"),
and fixed structural headers from the template below (`Findings`, `Summary`,
`Module Dependency Graph`, `Critical`, `Warning`, `Suggestion`).

Consequence: [what breaks or gets worse if this is not fixed]
Remedy: [concrete, specific action]

### 🟡 Warning

**[Risk Name] — [Short descriptive title]**
Symptom: ...
Source: ...
Consequence: ...
Remedy: ...

### 🟢 Suggestion

**[Risk Name] — [Short descriptive title]**
Symptom: ...
Source: ...
Consequence: ...
Remedy: ...

## Summary

[2–3 sentences: what is the most important action, and what is the overall trend]
```

## Health Score Calculation

Base score: 100
Deductions:
- Each 🔴 Critical finding: −15
- Each 🟡 Warning finding: −5
- Each 🟢 Suggestion finding: −1
Floor: 0 (score cannot go below 0)
