> *"The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned."*
> — Frederick Brooks, *The Mythical Man-Month* (1975)

**50 years later, Brooks was still right — and so were McConnell, Fowler, Martin, Hunt & Thomas, Evans, Ousterhout, Winters, Meszaros, Osherove, Feathers, and the Google Testing team.**

Most code quality tools count lines and cyclomatic complexity. **brooks-lint** goes deeper — it diagnoses your code against six decay risk dimensions synthesized from ten classic engineering books, producing structured findings with book citations, severity labels, and concrete remedies every time.

## The Ten Books

| Book | Author | Contributes to |
|------|--------|----------------|
| *The Mythical Man-Month* | Frederick Brooks | R2, R4, R5 |
| *Code Complete* | Steve McConnell | R1, R4 |
| *Refactoring* | Martin Fowler | R1, R2, R3, R4, R6 |
| *Clean Architecture* | Robert C. Martin | R2, R5 |
| *The Pragmatic Programmer* | Hunt & Thomas | R2, R3, R4, R5, T2, T3 |
| *Domain-Driven Design* | Eric Evans | R1, R3, R6 |
| *A Philosophy of Software Design* | John Ousterhout | R1, R4 |
| *Software Engineering at Google* | Winters, Manshreck & Wright | R2, R5 |
| *Working Effectively with Legacy Code* | Michael Feathers | T4, T5, T6 |
| *xUnit Test Patterns* | Gerard Meszaros | T1, T2, T3, T4 |

## The Six Decay Risks

brooks-lint evaluates your code across **six decay risk dimensions** synthesized from ten classic engineering books:

| Decay Risk | Diagnostic Question | Sources |
|------------|---------------------|---------|
| 🧠 Cognitive Overload | How much mental effort to understand this? | Code Complete, Refactoring, DDD, Philosophy of SD |
| 🔗 Change Propagation | How many unrelated things break on one change? | Refactoring, Clean Architecture, Pragmatic, SE@Google |
| 📋 Knowledge Duplication | Is the same decision expressed in multiple places? | Pragmatic, Refactoring, DDD |
| 🌀 Accidental Complexity | Is the code more complex than the problem? | Refactoring, Code Complete, Brooks, Philosophy of SD |
| 🏗️ Dependency Disorder | Do dependencies flow in a consistent direction? | Clean Architecture, Brooks, Pragmatic, SE@Google |
| 🗺️ Domain Model Distortion | Does the code faithfully represent the domain? | DDD, Refactoring |

> Philosophy of SD = *A Philosophy of Software Design* (Ousterhout) · SE@Google = *Software Engineering at Google* (Winters et al.)

## What It Looks Like

Given this code:

```python
class UserService:
    def update_profile(self, user_id, name, email, avatar_url):
        user = self.db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
        user['email'] = email
        ...
        if user['email'] != email:   # always False — silent bug
            self.smtp.send(...)
        points = user['login_count'] * 10 + 500
        self.db.execute(f"UPDATE loyalty SET points={points} WHERE user_id={user_id}")
```

brooks-lint produces:

---

**Health Score: 28/100**

*This method concentrates four unrelated business responsibilities into a single function, contains a logic bug that silently suppresses email change notifications, and is wide open to SQL injection.*

### 🔴 Change Propagation — Single Method Changes for Four Unrelated Business Reasons
**Symptom:** `update_profile` performs profile field updates, email change notifications, loyalty points recalculation, and cache invalidation all in one method body.
**Source:** Fowler — *Refactoring* — Divergent Change; Hunt & Thomas — *The Pragmatic Programmer* — Orthogonality
**Consequence:** Any change to the loyalty formula risks breaking email notifications and vice versa. Every edit carries regression risk across four unrelated domains simultaneously.
**Remedy:** Extract `NotificationService`, `LoyaltyService`, and `UserCacheInvalidator`. `UserService.update_profile` should orchestrate by calling each — it should hold no implementation logic itself.

### 🔴 Domain Model Distortion — Silent Logic Bug: Email Notification Never Fires
**Symptom:** `user['email'] = email` overwrites the old value before `if user['email'] != email` — the condition is always `False`. The notification is dead code.
**Source:** McConnell — *Code Complete* — Ch. 17: Unusual Control Structures
**Consequence:** Users are never notified when their email address changes. Silent data integrity failure — the system appears functional while violating a business rule.
**Remedy:** Capture `old_email = user['email']` before any mutation. Compare against `old_email`, not `user['email']`.

*(+ 6 more findings including SQL injection, dependency disorder, magic numbers)*

### Architecture Audit with Dependency Graph

In Mode 2 (Architecture Audit), brooks-lint generates a **Mermaid dependency graph** at the top of the report. Modules are color-coded by severity: red = Critical findings, yellow = Warning, green = clean.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph src/api
        AuthController
        UserController
    end
    subgraph src/domain
        UserService
        OrderService
    end
    subgraph src/infra
        Database
        EmailClient
    end

    AuthController --> UserService
    UserController --> UserService
    UserController --> OrderService
    OrderService --> UserService
    OrderService --> EmailClient
    UserService --> Database
    EmailClient -.->|circular| OrderService

    classDef critical fill:#ff6b6b,stroke:#c92a2a,color:#fff
    classDef warning fill:#ffd43b,stroke:#e67700
    classDef clean fill:#51cf66,stroke:#2b8a3e,color:#fff

    class OrderService,EmailClient critical
    class AuthController warning
    class UserService,UserController,Database clean
```

The graph renders natively in GitHub, VS Code, and Notion — no extra tools needed.

## Benchmark

Tested across 3 real-world scenarios (PR review, architecture audit, tech debt assessment):

| Criterion | brooks-lint | Claude alone |
|-----------|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Structured findings (Symptom → Source → Consequence → Remedy) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% |
| Book citations per finding | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% |
| Severity labels (🔴/🟡/🟢) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% |
| Health Score (0–100) | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% |
| Detects Change Propagation | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% |
| **Overall pass rate** | **94%** | **16%** |

The gap isn't what Claude *can* find — it's what it *consistently* finds, with traceable evidence and actionable remedies every time.

## How It Compares

| | brooks-lint | ESLint / Pylint | GitHub Copilot Review | Plain Claude |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Detects syntax & style issues | — | ✅ | ✅ | ~ |
| Structured diagnosis chain | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Traces findings to classic books | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Consistent severity labels | ✅ | ✅ | ~ | ❌ |
| Architecture-level insights | ✅ | ❌ | ~ | ~ |
| Domain model analysis | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ~ |
| Zero config, no plugins to install | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Works with any language | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

> `~` = occasionally / inconsistently

**brooks-lint doesn't replace your linter.** It catches what linters can't: architectural drift, knowledge silos, and domain model distortion — the problems that slow teams down for months before anyone notices.

/brooks-lint:brooks-debt            # Claude Code
/brooks-debt                        # Gemini CLI
$brooks-lint                        # Codex CLI (then say "assess tech debt")
```

Classifies your debt across the six decay risks, scores each finding by Pain × Spread priority, and produces a prioritized repayment roadmap with Critical / Scheduled / Monitored classification.

### Test Quality Review

```
/brooks-lint:brooks-test            # Claude Code
/brooks-test                        # Gemini CLI

```

Audits your test suite against six test-space decay risks — Test Obscurity, Test Brittleness, Test Duplication, Mock Abuse, Coverage Illusion, and Architecture Mismatch — sourced from xUnit Test Patterns, The Art of Unit Testing, How Google Tests Software, and Working Effectively with Legacy Code. PR reviews also include a lightweight Step 7 Quick Test Check automatically.

## Configuration

Place a `.brooks-lint.yaml` in your project root to customize review behavior:

```yaml
version: 1

disable:
  - T3   # skip coverage metrics check — we don't enforce coverage

severity:
  R1: suggestion   # downgrade Cognitive Overload findings for this domain

ignore:
  - "**/*.generated.*"
  - "**/vendor/**"
```

Copy [`.brooks-lint.example.yaml`](.brooks-lint.example.yaml) as a starting point.
All settings are optional — omit the file entirely for default behavior.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `disable` | Risk codes to skip (`R1`–`R6`, `T1`–`T6`) |
| `severity` | Override severity tier (`critical` / `warning` / `suggestion`) |
| `ignore` | Glob patterns for files to exclude |
| `focus` | Evaluate only these risk codes (cannot combine with `disable`) |

## Why These Books, Why Now?

In the age of AI-assisted coding, we're writing more code faster than ever. But the insights from six decades of software engineering haven't changed:

> *"The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one."*
> — Frederick Brooks

AI can help you write code faster, but it can't tell you whether you're building a cathedral or a tar pit. **brooks-lint bridges that gap** — it brings the hard-won wisdom of six classic engineering books into your modern development workflow.

The decay risks these authors identified are more relevant than ever:
- **Adding AI assistants** doesn't fix cognitive overload or domain model distortion
- **Generating more code** increases change propagation and knowledge duplication
- **Moving faster** makes accidental complexity and dependency disorder even more dangerous
